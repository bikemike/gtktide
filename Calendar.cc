  // Reindex the events by date (see comments in Calendar.hh).

  // For mode C or form c, events are sorted as usual.  But in the
  // other cases, where we have columns labeled max-min-max or
  // slack-flood-slack-ebb, subordinate station time warp anomalies
  // such as two high tides occurring consecutively with no
  // intervening low tide wreak havoc on the logic that matches
  // columns to tide events.

  // For maxes, mins, and slacks for which an offset was provided,
  // sanity can be restored by sorting on the original timestamps
  // instead of the corrected timestamps.  But interpolated slacks
  // have no original timestamps, and if the surrounding events from
  // which they were interpolated are anomalous, their ordering
  // relative to the other events could be indeterminate.  In the
  // presence of a time warp, SubordinateStation would be entitled to
  // find the same slack event at more than one timepoint.  (In
  // practice, it seems reluctant to find interpolated slacks in
  // anomalous cases, which is just as well.)

  // Sun and moon events and mark crossings have unique assigned
  // columns, so their sorting relative to the remaining events is
  // unimportant.  All that matters is that they remain in
  // chronological order relative to other events of the same type.

  // What matters for interpolated slacks is that the normal cases do
  // the right thing and the anomalous cases do something that isn't
  // catastrophic.

  // Consequently, the following procedure is used to reorder events
  // before their disposition into the calendar.

  // 1.  Maxes, mins, and slacks for which an offset was provided are
  // ordered by their original timestamps.

  // 2.  All other events are ordered by their regular timestamps.

  // 3.  The two lists are merged by regular timestamp, with events
  // from each list being kept in the same relative order.  The
  // merging is nonstandard since one of the lists is not necessarily
  // in sorted order.

  // There is no StrictWeakOrdering on TideEvents that would produce
  // the same result.

  // For reference stations, uncorrectedEventTime is always null, so
  // the sort and merge don't do anything.
