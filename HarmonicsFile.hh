/*  HarmonicsFile  Hide details of interaction with libtcd.

    Although a few method signatures elsewhere in XTide have been
    optimized for compatibility with libtcd, at least 95% of the work
    of integrating XTide with a different database should be
    concentrated in re-implementing this class.
