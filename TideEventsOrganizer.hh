  // event is considered a duplicate if the difference in times is
  // less than Global::eventSafetyMargin and the event type is the
  // same.  This heuristic is almost always correct, and when it is
  // wrong, the affected events are probably anomalous to begin with.

  // The test for duplicates does not satisfy the mathematical
  // definition of an equivalence relation (it is not transitive).
  // Consequently, the duplicate elimination cannot be delegated to
  // the STL.  Also, inserting the same set of events in a different
  // order can get different results.
