    1. XTide is Copyright (C) 1998 by David Flater, comes with absolutely
       no warranty, and is provided under the GNU General Public License.
       See the verbose documentation for all of the relevant disclaimers.
    2. XTide requires:
          + [4]libXpm 3.4 or newer compatible version
          + [5]libpng version 0.96 or newer compatible version
          + [6]zlib (a.k.a. libz) version 1.0.4 or newer compatible
            version
          + [7]libtcd version 2.2 or newer compatible version
    3. You must download at least one harmonics file.  See
       [8]http://www.flaterco.com/xtide/files.html#harmonicsfiles for
       details on where to get these.
    4. You must set the environment variable HFILE_PATH to point to the
       harmonics files that you downloaded.  Example:

export HFILE_PATH=/usr/local/share/xtide/harmonics-free.tcd:/usr/local/share/xti
de/harmonics-nonfree.tcd

    5. ./configure; make
    6. You should now have three binaries:
          + xtide, the interactive X-windows client
          + tide, the non-interactive TTY client
          + xttpd, the web server
    7. The X-windows client is easy to use.  Go for it.
    8. tide does a few things that xtide doesn't do.  Run it with nothing
       on the command line and read the usage info.
    9. xttpd is a self-contained web server.  su root, fire it up and
       browse away.  If it doesn't run, check your logs for errors and see
       [9]http://www.flaterco.com/xtide/installation.html for
       configuration help.
