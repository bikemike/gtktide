   Very few of the ideas and very little of the know-how implemented in
   XTide originated with me.  I just took the ideas and knowledge of
   others and turned them into software.

   Underneath all the fluff, the central tide prediction algorithm
   implemented by XTide is by the book, specifically U.S. Coast and
   Geodetic Survey Special Publication 98 by Paul Schureman.  It was
   originally published in 1924.  Fans of retrocomputing might be
   interested to know that tide graphs of the style produced by XTide were
   once produced by machines that implemented the algorithm in hardware,
   in the hardest sense of the word (see Figure 1, or read all about them
   at [5]http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/predmach.html).

   Since we do it on a computer now, we had to make it a lot more
   complicated by handling subordinate stations, time zones, umpteen
   different output modes and formats, etc.  For those complications, I
   thank my colleagues ;-)

   XTide 1 began as nothing but a tide clock with no other modes and very
   few details.  It grew like a weed with code and ideas being contributed
   by a small but industrious group of people.  Actually, "weed-like" is a
   very accurate description of how it grew.  Clone-and-hack was all the
   discipline we had.  Before long, the command line was cluttered with
   poorly factored, specialized switches, and you couldn't change anything
   without changing the same thing in nine places.  In short, the weeds
   took over the lawn.

   XTide 2 was the result of a unilateral crusade to impose a coherent
   architecture so that the thing would become maintainable again.  Since
   that rewrite, outside contributions have been less frequent, but no
   less important.

   In terms of actual source code in XTide 2, the people who contributed
   big chunks were:

     Jan C. Depner was prolific in delivering the flat map, the World
     Vector Shoreline code, libtcd, tcd-utils, and inferred
     constituents.  Most of his work was paid for by the U.S. Naval
     Oceanographic Office, making them the first organizational sponsor
     of XTide development.  Thanks!

     John Thorstensen allowed me to reuse code from his skycal
     distribution ([6]ftp://iraf.noao.edu/contrib/skycal.tar.Z) to get
     the sun and moon calculations.

     Geoffrey T. Dairiki's fast root-finding code survives in XTide 2
     with only a C++ veneer.

   For the "black magic" of Congen and Harmgen, I had some mentors:

     The late Edward P. Wallner was a mentor for several years.  With his
     assistance, I was able to fill in enough of the gaps in my
     understanding of SP 98 to write the Congen program.  Along with Hugh
     Casement, he helped to sort out differences in the tidal
     constituents used in various countries.  Ed's own tide-predicting
     shareware (now freeware) is archived for posterity at
     [7]ftp://ftp.flaterco.com/wallner/.

     Charles Read and Björn Brill provided the tutoring required for me
     to write the Harmgen program.

     The support for Doodson style constituents in Congen was
     accomplished by reading and learning from Michael Foreman's
     publications and software, which were available at
     [8]http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/sci/osap/projects/tidpack/tidpack_e.

   Other contributions in no particular order:

     Thanks to Walt Bilofsky, August Hahn and Bob Kenney for
     miscellaneous help with data maintenance.

     Thanks to everyone mentioned in the [9]changelog for various
     patches, enhancements, and bug fixes.

     Thanks to those who [10]packaged XTide for Linux distributions and
     built contrib packages.

     Thanks to those who [11]ported XTide to other operating systems.

     Thanks to Alan Eugene Davis for especially diligent beta testing.

   The XTide 1 contributions are summarized below.  I apologize if anyone
   has been forgotten.

     People who submitted big chunks of code:  Jeff Dairiki, Jack
     Greenbaum, Dean Pentcheff, and Jef Poskanzer.

     People who submitted bug fixes, portability patches, and the like:
     Simon Burge, Jeff Dairiki, Andrew Davidson, Geoff Kuenning, Rob
     Miracle, Stan Uno, and Eric Rosen.

     People who ported XTide to other platforms:  Walt Bilofsky, Dale
     DePriest, Mikhail Fridberg, Mike Hopper, Paul C. Roberts and "Alex"
     somebody.

     Alan Eugene Davis, Dale DePriest, Jack Greenbaum, Phil Hughes, Bob
     Kenney, Dean Pentcheff, Jef Poskanzer, Graeme Rae, Greg Seidman,
     Jeff Small, Tom Varga, and Georg Vollmers.

     Scott Hemphill, Jean-Pierre Lapointe, Dean Pentcheff, Frank Smith,
     Toru Suzuki, Ed Wallner, and "George" somebody.

     The original interpolation algorithm for subordinate stations with
     unequal offsets was contributed by Jean-Pierre Lapointe.

     Jeff Small wrote the original XTide man page.

   Finally, thanks to all the other testers and folks who complain when
   something breaks--you know who you are :-)
